      <description>So a while back I read a blog post by ChunkHost about a &amp;ldquo;Huge security hole in Sendgrid&amp;rdquo;. And instantly I thought why isn&amp;rsquo;t there a protection against something which is so obviously dodgy. After a few seconds I thought of an easy protection against such an attack, I&amp;rsquo;ve now found time to write about it so here it is.
#The attack
The attack was simple, someone phoned up Sendgrid&amp;rsquo;s customer support and talked them into changing the email for the ChunkHost account from support@chunkhost.</description>
