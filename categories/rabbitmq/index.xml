      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a distributed application that requires multiple workers to process items from a queue. I decided to use RabbitMQ as the queue. However I noticed that there was a 10 minute pause or whenever the consumer started up. After looking into it further I noticed that it appeared that only one consumer could run at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing a lot of searching and looking at various documents and trying to see if it was the library I was using. I discovered that I had to set the number of items prefetched. Once I did this my consumers were able to start almost instantly consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I set the prefetch configuration using the Qos command. In Go and in PHP (since I had a PHP version to see if it was just the library in Go I was using.)&lt;/p&gt;
