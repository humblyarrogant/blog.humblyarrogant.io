      <description>Being a lover of testing, continuous intergration, and cloud services. I wanted to be able to get a build of status of a Revel framework app I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Since Revel uses it&amp;rsquo;s own command to run and build applications the standard way of doing a build for Golang are out. I wanted to use Drone.io instead of travis so if I wanted to make it private I could without paying a lot.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a rather unsual error with our testing suite while running on Jenkins. The test would pass on our development environment, not exactly odd in itself. Sadly they aren&amp;rsquo;t exact copies, patch level out and what not. However the test would pass on the Jenkins server if ran via command line. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that a minor release had a bug fix that was causing the issue. Since after all my googling on the subject turned up nothing I thought I would write up how I found out what it was and what the cause and solution was.</description>
