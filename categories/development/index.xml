      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In development we constantly bemoan bad developers. But what I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is everyone generally thinks they&amp;rsquo;re doing a good job and the other developers are bad. I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can exactly define what is  a good developer down to a tee but I think you can have rough benchmarks for whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re good. These generally are if you follow well defined practices. There are levels of development practices ranging from the basics (DRY) to advance (CQRS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my opinion that you&amp;rsquo;re only as good as the level of practices that you are able to follow well. So if you&amp;rsquo;re only able to do intermediate practices, then you&amp;rsquo;re an intermediate developer. If you do intermediate practices well but can&amp;rsquo;t implement advance practices properly you&amp;rsquo;re still an intermediate developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to say that my definition of well, is applying them in the majority of cases. No one is perfect, we obviously make mistakes and write poor code from time to time for various reasons. Also it&amp;rsquo;s important to state this isn&amp;rsquo;t a 100% guide as there are most likely hundreds of things I&amp;rsquo;m not thinking of or probably even know of. I&amp;rsquo;m also an OO PHP developer so a lot these may be related to OO. However I suspect majority of them can also be applied to other programming paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also not saying I do all of these things. I&amp;rsquo;m just aware they exist and I rank them at a certain level. Some times I don&amp;rsquo;t even think I have a full grasp of the concept. Nor am I making any claims that I&amp;rsquo;m any good. Like everyone I am still learning and trying to be a good developer. I think understanding our flaws helps with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;basics&#34;&gt;Basics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals every programmer should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dry-don-t-repeat-yourself&#34;&gt;DRY - Don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider this programming 101. It&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental practice which nearly all good development practices are built upon. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple, the aim is to never repeat yourself. Easiest time to know if you&amp;rsquo;re breaching this is if you literally copying and pasting code from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However sometimes the repetition can be more subtle. Such an example is you could end up having to transform data from one format to another repeatedly throughout your system. Like the example below. Every time you want to use the data from getData you have to call unserialize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$data = unserialize(getData());&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;encapsulation&#34;&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulation is when you round up stuff that are related and put them together. I feel this is very important thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a simple case, say you want to do create an invoice. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to have use an object to add items to the invoice and then you use a different object to get the total for the invoice. You would want to use one object to add lines and when you added the lines and then use the same object to get the total value of the invoice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the the example of breaching DRY. The data was stored in a specific format however as far as the rest of the system is concerned it needs to be another format. Therefore you should encapsulate the logic of how it&amp;rsquo;s stored to the storage layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulation doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it&amp;rsquo;s all in one class. But in the same place, be that module, class, namespace. For example you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to be doing Delivery logic in your Invoice module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits are very simple if you want to know how something works you just look in one place. If you want to change how something works you just make the change in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;intermediate&#34;&gt;Intermediate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the things you&amp;rsquo;re generally asked/asking about in interviews for experienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;single-responsibility&#34;&gt;Single responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of Single responsibility is that each object so only be responsible for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example you should never have a class that is responsible for inserting data in to the database and for making HTTP requests to AWS to create new server instances. So you would have a class that would do the insertion into the database and then another class to create new AWS instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing about Single responsibility is that all things that change for the same reason should be grouped together. So if you&amp;rsquo;re writing and reading from the database these will always change at the same time, so you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a class for writing and one for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick guide to know if you&amp;rsquo;re breaching Single responsibility, you ask yourself what does this class do and if you use the word &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re probably breaching single responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-close-principal&#34;&gt;Open/close principal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open/close principal means your class is open to extension but closed to modification. The basics of it is I should be able to extend a class to add extra functionality. I however should not be able to change how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example an Order entity class. I should be able to extend it so I can describe specific kinds of Orders such as PrePaidOrder and CreditOrder. But I should not be able to change it to say remove a field within the order entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example I should be able to extend a sorting class so it can sort other kinds of things but I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to change it from a sorting class to first item found class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;liskov-s-object-replacement&#34;&gt;Liskov&amp;rsquo;s object replacement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object replacement principal is that I should be able to replace any object with one of the same type and not change the behavior of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if I change the database class for another the application should not go from saving data about servers to managing the AWS instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interface-segregation&#34;&gt;Interface segregation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interface segregation is simply just Single responsibility but for interfaces. The basics of it is no object should be forced to implement a method that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example a translator class can implement a catalog interface and a translation interface. However you can build translation classes that don&amp;rsquo;t need to provide the translation catalog to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some quick ways to know it&amp;rsquo;s being breached, if classes implementing it have empty methods. As well as if you&amp;rsquo;re creating new interfaces that merge two other interfaces into one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dependency-inversion&#34;&gt;Dependency Inversion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with Dependency injection, which Dependency Inversion helps with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dependency Inversion is when you make your class coupled to an abstract/composite instead of the concrete version. So your class never knows about the existence of the actual implement that it&amp;rsquo;ll use. While the implementation class never knows about the existence of anything that uses it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes Dependency injecting and object replacement really simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;automated-testing&#34;&gt;Automated Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you use write unit/integration/system tests so you can test you entire code easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note this isn&amp;rsquo;t just doing TDD, but any testing. While I fully believe that TDD is the best way to test and write code. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s the only way or that by writing tests after you wrote the code makes you any less of a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have tests and you change something, how can you be sure it works? Simply you don&amp;rsquo;t. Even when you don&amp;rsquo;t have tests you still test your code, you just do it by hand. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t as anywhere near efficient as having it done by code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;correct-tool-for-correct-job&#34;&gt;Correct tool for correct job&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly an official practice per say. But it seems like such an obvious thing. Using the correct tool for the correct job seems obvious, but it&amp;rsquo;s quite often breached. How often have you used something other than a bottle opener to open a bottle of beer. This is not just a software developer problem, but I believe to be a really good developer then consistently you will use the correct tool for the correct job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of not using the correct tool for the correct job. Putting functions in a class then just calling those functions procedurally. Using automated testing tools to monitor your production web application. Using static code analysers to run your CI. Using MongoDB to store relational and transactional data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;advance&#34;&gt;Advance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this level a lot of these things seem to go hand in hand in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;law-of-demeter&#34;&gt;Law of Demeter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is very simple your code only ever talks to/uses objects it knows exists directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you inject a request object into a method that method should then never access the request object to get to a parameter bag object. Instead what you do is create a method on the request object that calls the parameter bag object and returns the data you want. The benefits of this means you can refactor easier since you can clearly see where code is used and where it isn&amp;rsquo;t. So if you were to change how the parameter bag works you only have to change it in the request class and not in every place the request class is used to pass the parameter bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also makes unit testing a lot easier since you don&amp;rsquo;t need to mock the request class and then mock the parameter bag. You just mock the request class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cqrs-command-query-responsibility-segregation&#34;&gt;CQRS - Command query responsibility segregation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command query read segregation is a principal at the heart of is about separating your reads from your writes. In my opinion you can apply this on several levels. For almost everything I think a on method level applies. But there is also on class level. And then there is system/service level which is actually the proper CQRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the method level no method that does a read should also be doing a write. But on an class level you no class that does reads should be doing writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the proper definition of CQRS, a command is something that does a write. A query is something that does a read. When doing commands to the system you should use a different pathway/service than if you were just querying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-modeling&#34;&gt;Domain modeling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simplest form this is separating the Domain/business logic away from the rest of the code and understanding what is part of the domain and what is actual implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-driven-design&#34;&gt;Domain Driven Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a rather complex topic and this little section will not give it any justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing DDD involves a lot more than just domain modeling. It means communicating with the business team to find the correct model for the domain and applying it. In my opinion the key to DDD is ubiquitous language. In which you use the same terminology as the the business people and then use that terminology in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design&#34;&gt;For more info see&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hexagonal-architecture&#34;&gt;Hexagonal Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hexagonal Architecture is simply isolating your domain model from your application layer and separating your application layer from third party items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have your domain model. Which should remain separate from everything and coupled to nothing. Next you have your application layer which is coupled to your domain model. At which point you have your outer layer which uses the application layer and third party items. Such as databases and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to change third party items without having to worry about your domain model or your how your application works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bdd&#34;&gt;BDD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior driven development is in it&amp;rsquo;s simplest form talking with the business team in a language they understand to workout what actually needs built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This again can get really complex and there are many different ways of doing BDD and many different practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/&#34;&gt;For more info see&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yagni-you-aren-t-gonna-need-it&#34;&gt;YAGNI - You aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna need it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YAGNI comes originally from Xtreme Programming and it&amp;rsquo;s a concept of don&amp;rsquo;t build something until you need it. As developers we look at our road map and see that in 6 months we&amp;rsquo;ll be building some feature that is semi related to what we&amp;rsquo;re currently working on. So we decide to implement the stuff that feature will need now while we&amp;rsquo;re in that area anyway. However the thing is roadmaps generally change and in 6 months that feature you have half implemented is no longer required and now you&amp;rsquo;re left with a bunch of useless code floating around your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This while it seems like a simple concept I think this is more about realising that YAGNI which I think can be quite hard to do at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tier-architecture&#34;&gt;Tier Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier Architecture is simply splitting out the responsibility of system responsibility on different layers of systems. So you start off with a web system layer which has no access to the database. Any time it needs to fetch something from the database it then makes a request to the database level which has the ability to do reads. Any time it needs to do a write it then makes a request to the write layer which then does writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-oriented-architecture&#34;&gt;Service Oriented Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when you build applications to handle specific jobs. Each service only knows about what it needs to do and is decoupled from other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for example if your application needs to send communication you could have a communication service that all it did was send communications. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t know about any of the logic about why the communication needs to be sent just that it needs to be send and does the sending. While the application doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to know about how the communication is being sent, just that it will be sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you use queues this can allow for services to go down and come back up while not affecting the speed of the web site. It also allows for you to scale out services as needed, so if you start out small you may only need to send a few communications but as you grow larger the number of communications goes up. This may not grow as much as your web traffic so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to scale it at the same pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;correct-terminology&#34;&gt;Correct Terminology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may sound a bit snobby we generally have a habit of using the wrong terminology when talking about thinks. While you may think what does it matter what it&amp;rsquo;s called? Well it doesn&amp;rsquo;t but it does matter if you&amp;rsquo;re able to correctly define to others what you&amp;rsquo;re doing or thinking about doing. For example if you say blackbox testing sucks when what you mean is System level testing sucks, it can lead to people like me pointing out that block box testing is very efficient way of testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I think of it is, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing what are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;not-included&#34;&gt;Not included&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think it should be noted things that are not listed here and to understand why I haven&amp;rsquo;t listed them. Personally I think you should probably do them all but I don&amp;rsquo;t think they necessary make you a better developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-outside-of-work-hours&#34;&gt;Programming outside of work hours&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people seem to think to be a good developer you must spend all your time Programming. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t think this is the case. One of the reasons is I think your brain needs time to rest. Also spending all your free time playing music doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect the quality of work you do during office hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;contributing-to-open-source&#34;&gt;Contributing to open source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While contributing to open source is great and will most likely help your fundamental software development skills. In my opinion it will also teach you some bad such as not fixing bugs because they&amp;rsquo;ve existed for so long people expect it to work like that. While I think that&amp;rsquo;s the correct thing to do with an open source project which other people rely on. Not fixing bugs in a private company because some people may expect it to work the broken way isn&amp;rsquo;t really good. I think all bugs should be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-in-more-than-one-language&#34;&gt;Programming in more than one language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to play with other programming languages and you will improve your development skills. I don&amp;rsquo;t think being able to code in C and Perl will make you a better PHP developer. Just because you know how to do terrible things in multiple languages doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you a better developer than one who knows how to do good things in only one language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-of-specific-tools&#34;&gt;Use of specific tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example I am not going to say to be a good developer you have to use Jenkins, a fully featured IDE, a good debugger tool, etc. While I would say you should use them, not using them doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect your ability to write high quality code. I just think they&amp;rsquo;ll make your life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-patterns&#34;&gt;Design patterns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design patterns are most certainly part of writing good clean high quality code. However I feel to often people ask &amp;ldquo;Do you use design patterns?&amp;rdquo;. Well the answer to that is generally always yes. Knowing the code you write is a design pattern doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you good. What makes you good is that you automatically wrote good code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think people try to jam design patterns into problems than solving the problem the design pattern solves. We seem to obsessed with design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t think your code is any less of if you solve a problem that has a design pattern with another method that is also clean and follows good development guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pair-programming&#34;&gt;Pair Programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some people who assume if you don&amp;rsquo;t pair program you&amp;rsquo;re not as good as the people who do. Some people just don&amp;rsquo;t like pair programming (myself included). While I think pair programming is smart and extremely useful in many situations I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should be defined as the only way to go in those situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-kata&#34;&gt;Code Kata&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think doing code katas is a lot of fun and a wise move. I just don&amp;rsquo;t think that not doing it removes you understanding and ability to implement any of the best practices in development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people think Continuous integration is simply running all your tests after each commit. Or even just using Jenkins before you merge so &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; is deployable. However Continuous integration is a practice of everyone working on the same branch and all committing to the same branch. So everyones work is integrated continuously. With the minimum of if you&amp;rsquo;re using branches that it&amp;rsquo;s merged into master at the end of the day. This in my opinion makes this a team discipline and not a single developers discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;agile&#34;&gt;Agile&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile in it&amp;rsquo;s many forms it a method of managing the project. You can be a good developer producing good work without doing Agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;round-up&#34;&gt;Round up&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is where it gets kinda complex and it&amp;rsquo;s mainly just my opinion. However I believe your ability to implement the above techniques, practice, patterns determine how good you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;junior&#34;&gt;Junior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my personal opinion that if you don&amp;rsquo;t implement the basics consistently then you are by definition not a good developer. There is one exception to this and that would be junior developers. Since these are things that you have to learn and get used to doing. But if you&amp;rsquo;ve been developing for any serious amount of time and you&amp;rsquo;re still not doing these things properly then no matter how advance the other techniques you use I still wouldn&amp;rsquo;t class you as a good developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;middleweight&#34;&gt;Middleweight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you look at the Intermediate skills and if you do say 3 out of the 6 there consistently and well. Then I would rank you as a middleweight developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a junior developer and are doing these things then I would class you as a good developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a senior developer or above and this is where you&amp;rsquo;re at I would consider you a poor developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;senior&#34;&gt;Senior&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you do 5 out of the 6 of the intermediate skills well and consistently then I would consider you as a senior developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a junior developer and you were doing these I would consider you an amazing developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a middleweight developer and you are doing these I would consider you a good developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a team lead or above and you weren&amp;rsquo;t doing these I would consider you poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-lead&#34;&gt;Team lead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I understand team leading is a lot to do with soft skills I still think their should be a high level of technical knowledge in the basic technical team lead position. A technical team lead in my opinion should be able to do 6 out of the 7 intermediate skills while doing 1-2 of the advance skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a senior and below and you reach this then I would consider you a good developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;higher&#34;&gt;Higher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re good at all of the intermediate skills then I would consider you a good developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re also good at multiple advance skills then I would consider you a great developer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I learned with a big database</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2017-01-15-what-i-learned-with-a-big-database/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 15:12:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2017-01-15-what-i-learned-with-a-big-database/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So I recently started a new side project that involves data mining. While working on this project I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a little bit about how to manage a larger than usual database. At the point of writing this the database is approximately 50GB and growing daily. So here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;backups&#34;&gt;Backups&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the main area where I learned a bunch of stuff. Usually when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a database of approximately 1GB in size, backups at midnight are rather routine. You run mysqldump and you&amp;rsquo;re done. However when your database gets larger and is constantly being used this suddenly becomes an actual task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-locks&#34;&gt;Table locks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original attempts to do mysqldump resulted in all my miners being unable to insert into the database. It turns out by default mysqldump locks all the tables. This becomes an issue when mysqldump takes 1+ hours to run. However you can use the &lt;code&gt;--single-transaction&lt;/code&gt; flag to make the mysqldump to start a transaction and use this for all the reads. That means the writes can continue while you&amp;rsquo;re doing a mysqldump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;compression&#34;&gt;Compression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running mysqldump I was creating the SQL file and then after that compressing it before transferring it to S3 for storage. This turns out isn&amp;rsquo;t the best approach as the reading and writing to the same disk can cause a slow down in the speed of the dump. You can reduce this by piping mysqldump&amp;rsquo;s output into a compression application directly. That way you&amp;rsquo;re writing less data to disk so your mysqldump isn&amp;rsquo;t waiting for disk io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found out that gzip still only uses one core by default. However someone nicely wrote an upgraded version that uses all cores, it&amp;rsquo;s called pigz. You can also use this with tar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;xtrabackup&#34;&gt;Xtrabackup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while I realised that mysqldump wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best choice for a backup when dealing with a 50+GB database. So I started looking into other methods. I ended up using Percona XtraBackup. This works by copying the innodb files instead of creating a sql file. You also need to use it to restore your backups. This performed almost 4 times faster than mysqldump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the parts of the backup process is applying the innodb logs that haven&amp;rsquo;t been executed yet. By default this took 12+ hours before I killed it. It turns out that it has a &lt;code&gt;--use-memory&lt;/code&gt; flag. By default it only uses very little memory. I&amp;rsquo;ve upped this to 7GB and it flew by in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tuning&#34;&gt;Tuning&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering my database is extremely write heavy at the moment (99% writes 1% reads). It turned out I need to improve the performance of my writes. I did this by tuning the MySQL settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two main settings I changed were: innodb_buffer_pool_size and innodb_log_file_size. This resulted in skyrocketing my write performance in comparison to what I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;replication&#34;&gt;Replication&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out that if I want to do any actual work on the data I&amp;rsquo;ve mined that I would have to create a master-slave replication setup. To avoid locking the tables and slowing down/killing my crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Symfony Password encoding</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2015-06-01-symfony-password-encoding/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 15:12:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2015-06-01-symfony-password-encoding/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;A very simple breakdown of how the password encoding works with Symfony 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;encoder-factory&#34;&gt;Encoder factory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encoder factory is where you get your password encoders from. You pass in a User entity and it returns an Encoder. Encoders are created from the encoder configs and stored within the factory, there is only a single instance of the encoder unless you clone it outside of the factory. The encoder configs are passed to the factory upon creation. Once a factory is created there is no way of adding new encoders as there is no add method and the internal class variable holding these is private. The encoder config array is generated from the encoders assigned to a user entity. If the encoder is not used by anything then Symfony just doesn&amp;rsquo;t load it. The config array is built using the key defined in the security.yml file as the key for the config array. So if you just define them by entity then your array config will just be class names. Once the encoder has been called that config is overridden by the encoder instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fetching an encoder you can either pass in a User entity or you can pass in the string of the class you want to find the encoder for. This behavior can be leaveraged so you define encoders with ids that aren&amp;rsquo;t class named and then just pass in the name of the encoder you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=one.yml&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=two.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-your-own-password-encoder&#34;&gt;Creating your own Password Encoder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create your own password encoder you have to create your own encoder class implementing &lt;code&gt;Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\PasswordEncoderInterface&lt;/code&gt; interface. You can extend the &lt;code&gt;Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\BasePasswordEncoder&lt;/code&gt; class which has several helper functions which you may want to use in your own Encoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example Encoder class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=three.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have created the class you have to define it in your services container configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=four.xml&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then to have it loaded into the Encoder factory you need to assign it to a user entity in your security.yml file like so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=five.yml&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;password-encoder-based-on-the-user-entity&#34;&gt;Password encoder based on the User entity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EncoderAwareInterface allows you to return the key for the encoder you want for that user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=six.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key for the encoder is key that was put into your security.yml config. In the below example we have bcrypt available as a key as well as &amp;ldquo;Icambridge\Entity\InsecureUser&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/5300b2a609a80492b657.js?file=seven.yml&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;userpasswordencoder&#34;&gt;UserPasswordEncoder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Encoder\UserPasswordEncoder is a class in the encoder namespace which doesn&amp;rsquo;t encode passwords and return them. Instead it takes a user entity and a string and fetches the password encoder for that user entity and then encodes the string using the encoder and sets the password on the user entity. It also has a isPasswordValid functionality to wrap the encoders you pass an User entity and a string and it fetches the encoder and details from the usesr entity and returns if the password given is valid for that user entity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hack: Types</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-11-23-hack-types/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 15:12:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-11-23-hack-types/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Hack bring lots of features that a lot of other programming languages get to take advantage of. One of major advantages of Hack over PHP is a typing system. So here&amp;rsquo;s a quick run over of the typing system as I understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;annotate&#34;&gt;Annotate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annotating is when you define which type is going to be used. You can type the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;function arguments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;function return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;class variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For function arguments you just put the type before the variable name for the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/26159043a232e7206b40.js?file=function.hh&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the return type you just put &lt;code&gt;: type&lt;/code&gt; in between the function definition and the function body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/26159043a232e7206b40.js?file=return.hh&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For constants you just put the type in between the &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword and the constant name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/26159043a232e7206b40.js?file=dd.hh&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For class variables you just put the type in between the scope keyword and the variable name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/26159043a232e7206b40.js?file=class.hh&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;list-of-basic-types&#34;&gt;List of basic types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primitive are one most basic types that are used in most programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; - Integer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; - Floating point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; - Boolean (True or False)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primitive Unions are types that can be used to describe other Primitive types that go together.
* &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; - integer or float
* &lt;code&gt;arraykey&lt;/code&gt; - string or integer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrays while being a primitive type can be expanded to show what type of data they hold. You can also define the array key type. Instead of typing arrays like this you may want to look at using collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; - An array of strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;array&amp;lt;string,int&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  - An array of integers indexed by a string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes and interfaces, if a class or interface exists in the code that&amp;rsquo;s being executed then it&amp;rsquo;s a type that you can use for type annotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other basic types&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mixed&lt;/code&gt; - Will take anything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; - Nothing it means there is no type, this is generally used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;resource&lt;/code&gt; - A resource such as filepointer, curl resources, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(function(typeOne, typeTwo, ...): returnType)&lt;/code&gt; - closure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuple(typeOne, typeTwo)&lt;/code&gt; - tuples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full list can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/hack.annotations.usingtypes.php&#34;&gt;hack annotations docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generics&#34;&gt;Generics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want your code to work with any type. In those cases we can use type generics. Generics can be defined on a class or on a method. To define a generic you wrap the name of the generic with less than and greater than in either the class definition or the method definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When naming it you should remember can&amp;rsquo;t use the name of a type that already exists. It&amp;rsquo;s a general rule of thumb that you start your generic type with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and for real simple use cases &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; alone is fine. With collections it&amp;rsquo;s advised to use &lt;code&gt;Tk&lt;/code&gt; for the key and &lt;code&gt;Tv&lt;/code&gt; for the value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/26159043a232e7206b40.js?file=generics.hh&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overriding-return-type-signature&#34;&gt;Overriding return type signature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you extend a class you are able to override the return type for methods you override. However the new type must be compatible with the original type. So in other word the type must be a child type of the original type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So say you originally typed it &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; you couldn&amp;rsquo;t then change the type to &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;. As that&amp;rsquo;s not a compatible type of &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. However if you created a child class of &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;Fooable&lt;/code&gt; you would be able to use that as a type. So your code still actually follows the orignal return signature it&amp;rsquo;s just more detailed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don&#39;t return null</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-11-01-dont-return-null/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2014 15:12:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-11-01-dont-return-null/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re programming in an object orientated language that supports exceptions you should never return null in a method that returns an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most object orientated languages support exceptions. Exceptions give us an extremely expressive way to represent error conditions. We throw an exception and the program bails out of where it is and then goes to the error handling section. We can create custom exceptions to express exactly what sort of error occured. This is how error handling in object orientated programming languages is meant to be done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning null on error comes procedural programming. In procedural programming it makes a lot of sense. In most procedural programming languages there is no other way to represent an error condition. The problem here is the user of the method has to do the error checking and manually handle the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally in the method where an error condition has occurred, there has been sort of logic check to see if everything is ok or if it&amp;rsquo;s an error condition. If we&amp;rsquo;re returning null then we have to do this logic again every time we use this method. Where as with an exception there is only the logic check in the method and then all the error handling is handled by try/catch switches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a method is meant to return an object developers naturally want to chain method calls on this. It just feels very natural and generally looks a lot cleaner. When we do this and an exception is flung our code just jumps to the exception handling. If we return null we end up with an error for calling a member method on a non object. In PHP a fatal error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throwing an exception instead of returning null, allows you to keep your code more consistent. You can make sure that methods always return a value of the same type. Removing the need for repeating the same sanity checks all over your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in overview we have more valid object orientated code, less repeating yourself, more consistent code, more expressive code, and cleaner code. Those all sound like pretty good reasons to stop returning null.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Opinion on testing code with 3rd party API calls</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-10-09-my-opinion-on-testing-code-with-3rd-party-api-calls/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2014 15:12:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-10-09-my-opinion-on-testing-code-with-3rd-party-api-calls/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently had a discussion about how I would go about testing code that makes calls to a remote third party API. It seems my way of thinking isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as most others. So I figured I would write out my thoughts and explanation behind why I would go for this route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;others-peoples-approach&#34;&gt;Others peoples approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first I want to explain other peoples thought patterns seem to be. It goes like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a wrapper around the API requesting code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write unit tests and mock the wrapper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write functional tests that include hitting the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this is to make sure your code still works with the API such as it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed with the functional test. While allowing yourself to just test your code on the unit level. Overall it gets the job done, I just think it&amp;rsquo;s slightly flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-approach&#34;&gt;My approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my plan of action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a wrapper around the API requesting code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write unit tests and mock the wrapper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write integration tests that mocks the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write smoke test the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is again we allow unit testing by wrapping and mocking. Then with the integration tests we ensure all the code within our application, even 3rd party code all integrate together and that everything goes well when the API returns what we expect. Then we smoke test the API to ensure it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed and all works the way we expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;reason-behind-my-approach&#34;&gt;Reason behind my approach&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocking and wrapping the API requesting code seems like a no brainer that everyone agrees with. We want to own the code we&amp;rsquo;re testing on a unit level. While decoupling ourselves to a certain extent from the third party API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocking the API is where most people think I&amp;rsquo;m being a bit crazy. I think the fact there is extremely good tools out there to do this such as robohyrda say I&amp;rsquo;m not that crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I would go down this route is you&amp;rsquo;re decoupling your test suite from the third party API. When you couple your test suite a third party I&amp;rsquo;ve found you end up with the following issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failed builds due to timeout issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failed builds due to API being unreachable completely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people running their tests at the same time and it creates conflicting states on the API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend a bunch of money paying for API calls for your tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your test suite time starts to increase more rapidly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for these reasons I would want to keep away from hitting third party APIs in my test suite. But yes you still want to test the API works the way you expect, which is why you run a smoke test which isn&amp;rsquo;t an isn&amp;rsquo;t build failure. But something you run on a regular basis to say that you&amp;rsquo;re code will still work or if you need to change out the API requesting code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;open-to-ideas&#34;&gt;Open to ideas&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve got another way of thinking I would really interested in hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I use Dependency Injection</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-06-05-how-i-use-dependency-injection/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2014 20:39:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-06-05-how-i-use-dependency-injection/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about dependency injection a lot recently and the best way to do it in a clean manner. I recently changed how I was injecting some dependencies, at code review I was asked why. So I figured I would write a blog post fully stating my current views on how to implement Dependency Injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main ways of injecting a single dependency, as well as what I would consider two ways of injecting multiple dependencies these are also known as patterns. Each with their own use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;single-dependency&#34;&gt;Single Dependency&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constructor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;multiple-dependencies&#34;&gt;Multiple Dependencies&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;constructor&#34;&gt;Constructor&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constructor method of injecting dependencies is when you pass the dependency in via the constructor when you&amp;rsquo;re creating the object. This is to be used when the dependency is a required dependency that isn&amp;rsquo;t going to change during the lifecycle of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So use case, an email sender dependency. It&amp;rsquo;s very unlikely that you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to change how you send emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=Constructor.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;setter&#34;&gt;Setter&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setter method is when you use a setter to set the dependency after the object has been initiated. You would use this if the dependency isn&amp;rsquo;t a required dependency or if it changes during the life cycle of the object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case for this a dependency on a database connection object in a model. You may want to change databases on a multi tennent application depending on what tennet you&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another use case for the setter method is if you want to use interfaces to show that the object has that dependency. For example the ContainerAware interface in the Symfony2. This allows you to give a class multiple dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=Setter.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;method&#34;&gt;Method&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method injection is when you injected it into the method you want to use it in. You would use this when you only need that dependency for that method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use case for this would be a date object in a calendar object. Where you would want to use the same object for multiple dates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=method.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;service-container&#34;&gt;Service Container&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Service container is when you store you dependencies in an object and then pass that around. This allows you to make all your dependencies easily available wihtout having to worry about injecting them individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=container.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;factory&#34;&gt;Factory&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factory pattern is an oldie but a goodie. Here you just create the object you require and return it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good when you need to build up a dependency. For example using an entity with the service container. So you have to clone the entity once it&amp;rsquo;s originally been injected and then you have to clone it each time you want to use it. Using the factory pattern you can hardcode the dependency within that class and then inject the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of the code without a factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=factory-wihtout.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/fa0cd7160709ac6b6218.js?file=factory-with.php&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is my current opinion on how to implement dependency injection and the different use cases. This will most likely evolve over time as I learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revel : How to use Drone.io for testing</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-04-26-revel-use-drone-io-for-testing/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Being a lover of testing, continuous intergration, and cloud services. I wanted to be able to get a build of status of a Revel framework app I&amp;rsquo;m working on. Since Revel uses it&amp;rsquo;s own command to run and build applications the standard way of doing a build for Golang are out. I wanted to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://drone.io&#34;&gt;Drone.io&lt;/a&gt; instead of travis so if I wanted to make it private I could without paying a lot. So taking the .travis.yml wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option either. It was shockingly simple to set up. It took 3 lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-3-lines&#34;&gt;The 3 lines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick breakdown of what is going on. First you install the revel framework, then you install the revel command. Then you call the revel command with the test command using import directory that will be used by go when it grabs your code. So in my case it was &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;revel test github.com/icambridge/sitrep&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revel : Force template format</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-04-26-revel-force-template-format/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 15:39:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-04-26-revel-force-template-format/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So in Revel you can have your template in several different formats: html, json, xml, or txt. This is super awesome. As it allows you to send the same data and display different formats - Obivously. It also determines what template to use based on the http request headers that have been sent. So if your request sends that it accepts application/xml it&amp;rsquo;ll use xml and if you request says application/json it uses json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All awesome. But what if I want to debug something that should only ever be json. Or even more interesting what if I sent that I accept html and json but with json second in the list. AngularJS seems to do this by default, took me a while to figure out what was going on. So I need a way of forcing revel to just use one file format no matter what the http headers are. Thankfully it&amp;rsquo;s super simple, one line in your controller action to set the Request member&amp;rsquo;s Format member to the desired format and it&amp;rsquo;ll use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/11321687.js?file=snippet.go&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in full example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Revel?</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-04-19-why-revel/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;So lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project to increase productivity when dealing with Bitbucket and Jenkins. As I am a web developer, it&amp;rsquo;s a web app. So one of the first questions when building an application these days seems to be what framework? This for me has taken a month to really decide. In the end I choose Revel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;at-first&#34;&gt;At first&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I decided to use Gorilla Web Toolkit. Which is a very minimalist framework(ish). It&amp;rsquo;s really just a bunch of components that you can use together to create web applications. I have no complaints about it. It all works very nicely. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t how I wanted to develop. I&amp;rsquo;m too used to controllers, I like the structure they provide. Gorilla&amp;rsquo;s muxer was pretty much a more powerful version of the default one that comes with Go. Where you either pass a function or you pass a struct that handles the request. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-own-framework&#34;&gt;My own framework&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing I decided was I would built my own simple framework. It would do exactly what I wanted. I worked on it for two weeks in my spare time. As I am just learning Go, this provided a perfect chance to get to know it better. I learnt about reflection and the basics of how it works. Increased my understanding of structs and inheritance. As well as a bunch of other stuff. However I realised I was spending all my time writing a framework and that&amp;rsquo;s not what I want to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;revel&#34;&gt;Revel&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use Revel because it&amp;rsquo;s pretty bloated, it&amp;rsquo;s a full on framework. Based on Play! which I had played with before in Scala. But I realised it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the only web framework that provides anywhere near what I am wanting in regards to routing and MVC. It&amp;rsquo;s also got the ability to recompile code on change so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to constant restart the application. So I decided to just rewrite everything over to Revel. Hopefully this will be a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>xvfb-run and wkhtmltopdf won&#39;t run in Jenkins/Apache</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-28-xvfb-run-wont-run-in-jenkins-apache/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 22:26:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-28-xvfb-run-wont-run-in-jenkins-apache/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a rather unsual error with our testing suite while running on Jenkins. The test would pass on our development environment, not exactly odd in itself. Sadly they aren&amp;rsquo;t exact copies, patch level out and what not. However the test would pass on the Jenkins server if ran via command line. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that a minor release had a bug fix that was causing the issue. Since after all my googling on the subject turned up nothing I thought I would write up how I found out what it was and what the cause and solution was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: It was caused by SE Linux, disabled it and everything started working fine. It also fixed an issue where wkhtmltopdf would return an error 1299 wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work when called via Apache.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the code that we were testing was a functional test controller, it would generate a pdf and force the download. All the test had to do was check and see if a file was downloaded. This constantly failed on the Jenkins server. The tools we use to generate pdfs is &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/&#34;&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml&#34;&gt;xvfb&lt;/a&gt; to allow for it to run without a GUI system. So I started trying to debug the command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xvfb-run &amp;ndash;server-args=&amp;ldquo;-screen 0, 1280x1024x24&amp;rdquo; /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/xx/workspace/app/../bin/wkhtmltopdf-amd64 &amp;ndash;use-xserver &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://localhost/xxx&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;https://localhost/xxx&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; /tmp/will-this-work.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;xvfb-run has an error log file parameter. When I added it, the error file was empty When I ran xvfb-run by itself via Jenkins it gave me the help message, when I called wkhtmltopdf by itself via Jenkins it gave me. So I then added a exec call to the Phing build file to see if just the command would work and if it was a PHP issue. This returned an error code of 1. Which isn&amp;rsquo;t really helpful since the error code just means had problems starting up. I then tried the xvfb plugin for Jenkins, that was pointless as that plugin is for a completely different use. I then installed the terminal plugin, tried the command there and it did the same. However I also ran &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; command to see if it was indeed running as the Jenkins user I tried in CLI. As it turned out I got an extra line (which sadly I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep a copy of) after googling that every result was about SE Linux. I then made the jump to disabling SE Linux. Once I did that via the test started to pass via Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ve put enough information in this post that if other people Google with this issue they&amp;rsquo;ll find this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Observer pattern in golang</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-22-observer-pattern-in-golang/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 10:37:14 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-22-observer-pattern-in-golang/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For some reason at some point, I thought it would be hard to implement the observer pattern in Go. Then I made an issue for me to blog about it. Well it&amp;rsquo;s not hard. It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as it is in every
other language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;observers&#34;&gt;Observers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First part of the observer pattern is you need the actual observers. The logic that you want executed whenever something happens. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve just put a simple log print statement that will print out the name of the hook to the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created an interface to allow for more flexible typing later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/9708081.js?file=interface.go&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;observer-notifier&#34;&gt;Observer Notifier&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main part of the logic, simply have an add observer and then have a process function that loops through and calls them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/9708081.js?file=observer.go&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{% gist 9708081 observer.go %}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;full&#34;&gt;Full&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a copy of it all together. As you can see it&amp;rsquo;s really simple to whack together once you have a half decent understanding of Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;script src=&#39;https://gist.github.com/9708081.js?file=main.go&#39;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Why hacking on production code during an interview is a good thing</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wrote this ages ago and just found it and figured I should post it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while back I saw a blog post (&lt;a href=&#34;http://hownottohireadeveloper.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/no-i-will-not-hack-on-your-codebase-for-free.html&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) saying that he would never hack on a production code base during the interview. Since he was not getting paid for it. Well I strongly disagree with that, both from an interviewee and an interviewer point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;interviewer&#34;&gt;Interviewer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working at my last job I was in charge of the technical test for developers. Instead of doing what was previously done which was get someone in and then test them. Which simply put wasted a bunch of time since most people were unable to pass the test, so you would waste 30 minutes talking to them and then find out that they can’t do the job in the first place. So instead of having them come in and then test them, what we did was test them before we even arranged an interview. In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical test that was in place when I was hired, was in my opinion faulty. It was a selection of how do you do this, how do you do that, spot the errors in this code, what is this, and spot the errors in this query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem with how to do this and how to do that questions in a technical test is that they generally ask how to do really simple things that you only really ever do when you’re starting out after a while you start automating to the point where you never do it. For example how to create a MySQL table. Off the top of my head I could give you a rough query that looks kinda like how the actual query looks. But it won’t work as the syntax will be wrong, I will have put the auto increment in the wrong place, put a comma after the column type field. When in reality I’ll use a GUI tool of some sort to do this, since it’s not something you generally do a lot it’s something you forget. Also when people come up with these questions it’s things they currently know but not always what they knew when they started that position. (Someone else originally made this point, but I can&amp;rsquo;t find who by googling so credit to the anonymous person)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem with spot the error questions is they are generally designed to catch people out. If you sit and spent an hour trying to catch people out, unless you’re really stupid you are going to be successful. Especially when you’re looking for syntax errors like a missing bracket, left a quotes open, etc. There is a reason why IDES, text editors highlight code syntax. It’s because it’s really hard to spot these errors. If you’re scanning 25 lines of code and find 8 errors. There is a pretty good chance you’re thinking you’ve found them all. Except you missed the one where it was a comma instead of a full stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with this all in mind. I created my test or to put it better tests. We had an IRC bot to give out information to the operations team. I had a list of things I wanted automated to make their lives easier. As this wasn’t something that would make the company money. I wasn’t allowed to spend time working on it. So instead of me working on it, I used those tasks as developer tests. We would send one out until someone wrote code good enough for us to use (then interview that person) and then start sending out another one. The test a lot of the time was very easy, write a plugin for the PHP IRC bot Phergie that would do something like check a web site is up, check a value in a database, etc and license it GPL V3. The reasons behind this aren’t just exploitation of the work market, the reason to constantly change the test was to stop people being able to cheat on it and send it someone else&amp;rsquo;s successful submission. (This happened after I left and they kept sending out the same test. One of the guys marking the test spotted it was the code he sent in.) It was also to see if they could write code we would use, if you can’t write code that we would use why do we want to interview you? You’re clearly not up to the job. This test saved us interviewing 3-4 people a week to interviewing 1-2 people a month. Interviewees were pretty much always offered a job after an interview except in one case where it was a personality thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;interviewee&#34;&gt;Interviewee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never actually been asked to hack on production code in an interview but I would love it if I was. Yes I would be giving them my work for free. But at the end of the day I don’t do my job for the money, I do it because it’s what I want to do. My last job I took because they were importing 50 million rows into MySQL twice daily, with 100 queries per second on that data. It was a challenge I’ve never had, it was fun. My current job I took because they allow me to unit testing and do continuous integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hacking on their codebase gives me something very important. A chance to see what I’ll be working with, a chance to see how good my co-workers will be, a chance to look at their deployment, and a chance for my code to do the talking. Because let’s be serious an interview is not just their chance to check you it, it’s your chance to check them out. If all you get is a couple of people talking to you asking some questions and then giving you a chance to ask questions at the end. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like it&amp;rsquo;s as good an opportunity. Also I never seem to ask any good questions anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;open-source-instead&#34;&gt;Open Source Instead?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post it was suggested that’ll he’ll hack on something open source and give something back. While in theory this totally awesome, in practice it seems like something that isn’t practical. Such was what open source project? What you going to do in that open source project? While there is always stuff needing done in open source projects, some are really hard to contribute to (WordPress for example) others don’t really have a list of stuff that they need done feature wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One place I interviewed at (&lt;a href=&#34;http://parall.ax&#34;&gt;Parallax&lt;/a&gt;) had another way, they asked me in for a hack day and asked if I had anything I wanted to code as a side project and then had me code that in their framework of choice. Then it was out for beers afterwards, pretty good interview. Turned out to be a kickass company, who I would readily suggest to anyone looking for digital agency or a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I could be worrying about am I getting paid for my work, I choose to worry about things I find more important. I’ve also noticed I also have a habit of working a lot of unpaid overtime. I obsess over my work. So worrying if I’m working for free isn’t something I worry about. I’ve found people who worry about getting paid for their work are the ones who don’t have a passion for what they do, leave 5 seconds after their contracted time. Which is fair enough. I would just rather my work was an enjoyable part of my life. Instead of working for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The git-flow branch model is waterfall?</title>
      <link>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-20-gitflow-is-waterfall-slash/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 15:23:04 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://blog.humblyarrogant.io/post/2014-03-20-gitflow-is-waterfall-slash/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;For those not in the know, git-flow is technically a tool for git which allows for the easy use of a specific branch model. Which is most commonly referred to as git-flow.  This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that tool which is super useful. But is about the branch model. Which is also super useful in my opinion if you&amp;rsquo;re implementing the waterfall development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a criticism of either the branching model or the waterfall process. It&amp;rsquo;s more me pointing out that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit in with what I consider to be an agile development process if used fully as described. Not to say that implementing some of it can&amp;rsquo;t fit in with an agile development process. Basically I&amp;rsquo;m trying not to be offensive to anyone. (Also it should be noted that listening to me may result in you looking stupid. You have been warned.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;git-flow-summary&#34;&gt;Git flow summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a quick run through of the branch model if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read &lt;a href=&#34;http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/&#34;&gt;the blog post about it&lt;/a&gt;. You basically branch each feature off into it&amp;rsquo;s own &lt;strong&gt;feature branch&lt;/strong&gt; and develop that separately from other features. When a feature is finished you then merge it into the &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt; branch. Once you feel you have enough features in &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt; you then merge it in to a &lt;strong&gt;release branch&lt;/strong&gt;. At which point you only test and apply bug fixes to that branch and once you&amp;rsquo;re ready to deploy it you then merge it to &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt;. Which is to be an exact copy of production. You then tag it once it goes into &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt;. Once it&amp;rsquo;s in &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt;, and you need to fix some urgent bug in production you would create a &lt;strong&gt;hotfix branch&lt;/strong&gt;. Any non urgent bug would be fixed in a &lt;strong&gt;bug branch&lt;/strong&gt; that is branched off from &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So over all you have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;feature branch&lt;/strong&gt; - Features get developed in these. In isolation so that you can release only fully finished features. Branch name example feature/comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt; - The main development branch, where all completed features are merged into and feature and bug branches are branched off from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;release branch&lt;/strong&gt; - A branch that is suggested to go to production at which point you test and then bug fix before going live. Branch name example release/0.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; - A carbon copy of production, that tags are created from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hotfix branch&lt;/strong&gt; - An urgent bug fix branch, that is branched off from &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt;.  Branch name example hotfix/dataleakage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bug branch&lt;/strong&gt; - A non urgent bug fix, that is branched off from &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt;. Branch name example bug/invalid-email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-i-like-about-this-branch-model&#34;&gt;Things I like about this branch model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That you develop features off in their own branch. This makes it super simple to keep unready features away from production. Bugs are developed in their own branch allows you to change stuff that may break other things and have the safety you&amp;rsquo;re not breaking everyone else&amp;rsquo;s working environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that branches are named so you know the purpose of the branch, if it&amp;rsquo;s a bug, a feature, or the development mainline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like-about-this-branch-model&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about this branch model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;release branch&lt;/strong&gt;. Its whole purpose is to implement the testing &amp;amp; bug fixing phase of waterfall. For anyone who has worked on a largish project using waterfall, will know this phase sucks. It just feels like a constant battle. You spend ages testing everywhere by hand, then fix everything you find, then spend more time testing everything by hand. By the end of it,  it feels like you&amp;rsquo;ve tested a section 100 times. You get that feeling deep down that you never want to see that section again. This in my opinion is the main problem, if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and get bored silly testing something by hand 100 times you&amp;rsquo;ll want to make it go as quickly as possible. This results in poor testing, which results in a product with more bugs. Since you&amp;rsquo;re holding up all your features on testing in one go, you end up with more spending what seems like more time testing, get bored quicker, and get sloppier. I just can&amp;rsquo;t see an upside to this method of testing by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also another downside of the release branch and its waterfall feel is that you&amp;rsquo;re not getting feedback quick enough. Say for example you have a financial statement and you only have a single column showing the amount of the transaction. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell you if it&amp;rsquo;s crediting the account or debiting the account to the extent the product owner would like. Then say you&amp;rsquo;ve then added onto the statement UI to make it load in via AJAX. You then have to change the UI and the AJAX endpoint to return the new data. If you were told when the UI was developed you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to go back and change the AJAX endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tagging on &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; every time you merge to it. It just seems like you&amp;rsquo;re not very trusting of the whole version control system. I agree that if you&amp;rsquo;re deploying to production you should creating a release a tag should be created, but if every time you commit to &lt;strong&gt;master&lt;/strong&gt; seems a bit much. I just feel it&amp;rsquo;s a bit much. Also I think that you should keep your development mainline so stable that it can be deployed at any point without any issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-feel-this-branch-model-should-be-used&#34;&gt;How I feel this branch model should be used&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature branches&lt;/strong&gt; are used to develop features independently of one another. When the feature is finished the feature is then tested and one agreed to the level of stability that it can be deployed. At which point it is then merged into &lt;strong&gt;develop&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows it to be tested and accepted quickly and allow for changes to be made as soon as possible and not result in cascading changes due to requirement changes. It also keeps your development mainline stable enough that you can deploy at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t think my suggested branch model is anywhere near perfect. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that waterfall feel to it. I feel code should be tested as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s written and finished and in small chunks. Yes there should be automated tests, however these don&amp;rsquo;t replace an actual user testing it nor do they replace the product owner looking at it and agreeing that&amp;rsquo;s what they want. The git flow branch model is clearly a successful one since so many people implement it, I just feel it&amp;rsquo;s not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to I need to get back to programming more things in my spare time. One way to kinda force this on myself is to attempt to do 100 days of github contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first aim is to write an actual project to do something I need. Currently one of the things I need is something to give me better overview of the status of builds on Jenkins. Currently I just know if the builds are passing or failing. What I want is to know what branches are passing and failing. More importantly to keep a track of the develop and master branches. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to build something to make that task easier on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commit a day. How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
