      <description>I recently came across a rather unsual error with our testing suite while running on Jenkins. The test would pass on our development environment, not exactly odd in itself. Sadly they aren&amp;rsquo;t exact copies, patch level out and what not. However the test would pass on the Jenkins server if ran via command line. So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that a minor release had a bug fix that was causing the issue. Since after all my googling on the subject turned up nothing I thought I would write up how I found out what it was and what the cause and solution was.</description>
