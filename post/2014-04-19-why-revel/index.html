    <h1>Why Revel?</h1>
    

<p>So lately I&rsquo;ve been working on a project to increase productivity when dealing with Bitbucket and Jenkins. As I am a web developer, it&rsquo;s a web app. So one of the first questions when building an application these days seems to be what framework? This for me has taken a month to really decide. In the end I choose Revel.</p>

<h1 id="at-first">At first</h1>

<p>At first I decided to use Gorilla Web Toolkit. Which is a very minimalist framework(ish). It&rsquo;s really just a bunch of components that you can use together to create web applications. I have no complaints about it. It all works very nicely. It just wasn&rsquo;t how I wanted to develop. I&rsquo;m too used to controllers, I like the structure they provide. Gorilla&rsquo;s muxer was pretty much a more powerful version of the default one that comes with Go. Where you either pass a function or you pass a struct that handles the request. It just wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted.</p>

<h1 id="my-own-framework">My own framework</h1>

<p>Next thing I decided was I would built my own simple framework. It would do exactly what I wanted. I worked on it for two weeks in my spare time. As I am just learning Go, this provided a perfect chance to get to know it better. I learnt about reflection and the basics of how it works. Increased my understanding of structs and inheritance. As well as a bunch of other stuff. However I realised I was spending all my time writing a framework and that&rsquo;s not what I want to build.</p>

<h1 id="revel">Revel</h1>

<p>I originally didn&rsquo;t want to use Revel because it&rsquo;s pretty bloated, it&rsquo;s a full on framework. Based on Play! which I had played with before in Scala. But I realised it&rsquo;s pretty much the only web framework that provides anywhere near what I am wanting in regards to routing and MVC. It&rsquo;s also got the ability to recompile code on change so you don&rsquo;t have to constant restart the application. So I decided to just rewrite everything over to Revel. Hopefully this will be a good decision.</p>
