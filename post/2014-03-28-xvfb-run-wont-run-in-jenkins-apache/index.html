    <h1>xvfb-run and wkhtmltopdf won&#39;t run in Jenkins/Apache</h1>
    <p>I recently came across a rather unsual error with our testing suite while running on Jenkins. The test would pass on our development environment, not exactly odd in itself. Sadly they aren&rsquo;t exact copies, patch level out and what not. However the test would pass on the Jenkins server if ran via command line. So it wasn&rsquo;t that a minor release had a bug fix that was causing the issue. Since after all my googling on the subject turned up nothing I thought I would write up how I found out what it was and what the cause and solution was.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: It was caused by SE Linux, disabled it and everything started working fine. It also fixed an issue where wkhtmltopdf would return an error 1299 wouldn&rsquo;t work when called via Apache.</strong></p>

<p>So the code that we were testing was a functional test controller, it would generate a pdf and force the download. All the test had to do was check and see if a file was downloaded. This constantly failed on the Jenkins server. The tools we use to generate pdfs is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/">wkhtmltopdf</a> and <a href="http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml">xvfb</a> to allow for it to run without a GUI system. So I started trying to debug the command.</p>

<p>Example command</p>

<blockquote>
<p>xvfb-run &ndash;server-args=&ldquo;-screen 0, 1280x1024x24&rdquo; /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/xx/workspace/app/../bin/wkhtmltopdf-amd64 &ndash;use-xserver &ldquo;<a href="https://localhost/xxx&quot;">https://localhost/xxx&quot;</a> /tmp/will-this-work.pdf</p>
</blockquote>

<p>xvfb-run has an error log file parameter. When I added it, the error file was empty When I ran xvfb-run by itself via Jenkins it gave me the help message, when I called wkhtmltopdf by itself via Jenkins it gave me. So I then added a exec call to the Phing build file to see if just the command would work and if it was a PHP issue. This returned an error code of 1. Which isn&rsquo;t really helpful since the error code just means had problems starting up. I then tried the xvfb plugin for Jenkins, that was pointless as that plugin is for a completely different use. I then installed the terminal plugin, tried the command there and it did the same. However I also ran <code>id</code> command to see if it was indeed running as the Jenkins user I tried in CLI. As it turned out I got an extra line (which sadly I didn&rsquo;t keep a copy of) after googling that every result was about SE Linux. I then made the jump to disabling SE Linux. Once I did that via the test started to pass via Jenkins.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ve put enough information in this post that if other people Google with this issue they&rsquo;ll find this.</p>
